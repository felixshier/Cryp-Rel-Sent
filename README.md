# Cryp-Rel-Sent
Cryptocurrency Relative Sentiment Analysis

## Abstract
This report investigates the relationship between relative social sentiment and relative price ratios for pairs of cryptocurrency assets. Specifically, this report will analyze possible solutions for predicting relative price ratios between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple through the use of publicly available Twitter data. The proposed solution is to use modern machine learning techniques to predict the change in relative prices between pairs of cryptocurrencies while taking relative social sentiment from Twitter as input. Specifically, this report will investigate the implementation of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, as well as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. These models will be designed with the common goal of taking in a sequence of relative sentiment data for a pair of cryptocurrencies as an input and outputting a predicted price ratio for the pair of cryptocurrencies at the next time step.
